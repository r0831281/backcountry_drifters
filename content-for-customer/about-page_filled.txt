Paragraph 2 Edit: 
About a decade ago our Head guide Bjorn, was introduced to drift boat trips no the Bow river by hiring some guides himself. After realizing how fun the trips were he quickly became obsessed with the need for his own boat. Building up from pontoon, to raft, to the ever popular and reliable CLACKACRAFT. This is our main vessel for float trips hosted by Bjorn himself. Years of on the water time and floating the Bow have translated into knowing seasonal flows, trout behaviors, safe water flows and knowing typical trout behavior through out the season.
